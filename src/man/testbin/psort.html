<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
psort - concurrent file system test
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/psort</tt> [<tt>-p</tt> <em>numprocs</em>]
[<tt>-k</tt> <em>numkeys</em>] [<tt>-r</tt> | <tt>-s</tt> <em>randomseed</em>]
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>psort</tt> does an on-disk parallelizing sort of a large number of
randomly generated integers.
It is loosely based on some real parallel sort benchmarks.
</p>

<p>
Be aware of its size vs. the size of your buffer cache, and adjust its
size as needed. Running it so it fits entirely in cache and running it
so it overflows the cache are both valid stress tests, but have quite
different characteristics.
</p>

<h3>Options</h3>
<ul>
<li> <tt>-k</tt> Set the number of integers. Default (for now) is 10000.
<li> <tt>-p</tt> Set the number of processes. Default is 4.
<li> <tt>-r</tt> Get a random seed from the <tt>random:</tt> device.
<li> <tt>-s</tt> <em>randomseed</em> Choose an explicit random seed.
</ul>
<p>
The basic workload size is the number of integers multiplied by the
byte size of an integer (here 4). The total size including
intermediate files is two or three times that.
<!-- XXX clarify this more -->
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>psort</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/open.html>open</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/dup2.html>dup2</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/read.html>read</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/lseek.html>lseek</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/close.html>close</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/stat.html>stat</A> or
     <A HREF=../syscall/fstat.html>fstat</A> (optional)
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/remove.html>remove</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/fork.html>fork</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/execv.html>execv</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/waitpid.html>waitpid</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>
It also execs <A HREF=../bin/cat.html>cat</A>.
</p>

<p>
<tt>psort</tt> should be able to run properly on SFS filesystems once
the basic system calls are implemented. However, you may need to
adjust its workload size depending on the level of large-file support
you have in SFS.
</p>

<p>
<tt>psort</tt> will mostly run on emufs, but there isn't really much
point in that.
